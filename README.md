# SHAREHOOD

## Description
The platform is a community-driven tool designed to promote sharing and collaboration within neighborhoods. It allows neighbors to list, borrow, and lend a variety of items, from tools and appliances to recreational equipment and household goods. By creating a trusted local network, the platform fosters a culture of resourcefulness, reduces unnecessary purchases, and strengthens the bonds between neighbors.

## Key Features
- **Item Listings**: Neighbors can easily post items they are willing to lend, complete with photos, descriptions, and availability.
- **Borrow Requests**: Users can search for items they need and send requests to borrow from their neighbors.
- **Secure Exchange**: The platform facilitates easy communication and coordination between lenders and borrowers to arrange item pick-ups and returns.
- **Trust System**: Ratings and reviews help build trust within the community by allowing users to rate their lending/borrowing experiences.
- **Notifications & Reminders**: Keep track of upcoming pick-ups, due dates, and reminders for returning items.
- **Local Focus**: The platform is geo-based, ensuring that all sharing is done within your immediate neighborhood for convenience and ease of access.

## Purpose
The platform aims to encourage sustainable living by reducing waste and the need for everyone to buy new items, while building a stronger sense of community. Whether it's borrowing a ladder for the weekend or sharing a bike for an afternoon, this project enables neighbors to make the most of what they already have.
